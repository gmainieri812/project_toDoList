TO DO LIST 

To Do List was a tool that I used a lot during the semester so I could organize myself with the subjects. First, 
I made my To Do List with Post-it, where I separated the disciplines by color, wrote down the tasks and as I was performing I crossed out the task performed. 
It was from this tool that the idea of creating my Semester Project came up. In my To Do List it is possible to add, edit, remove, search, and filter tasks. 
To run the project I started by creating a Semester Project folder and sub-folders for HTML, CSS, JS, and images. 
Then I started creating my HTML, creating the entire structure, creating classes and ID. Soon after I started styling the page in my CSS, 
trying to create some effects. After the two previous steps, I started to make my program in Javascript. I used Javascript to manipulate the DOM 
and store the data in Local Storage. I chose these technologies because I wanted to challenge myself and learn more about how this "integration" 
between HTML, CSS, and Javascript works. The experience I had on this project was very challenging, as I had to research different sources to understand 
how each technology works. Of all the topics learned in the course, I really liked DOM manipulation, I think it was in this part of the course where 
I saw something more tangible.
